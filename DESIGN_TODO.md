## OPEN — platform hygiene

- [ ] **tiletopia multi-node HA (raft)** — future reference, no open work. The
      openraft half of cluster.rs was deleted 2026-07-27: it was a never-compiled
      textbook key-value example wired to nothing (no transport, no discovery, no
      real server state through it). The single-process leader election that
      actually runs remains. If clustering ever becomes a requirement, design it
      around what needs replicating (catalog and auth state via Raft; tile data
      needs shared/object storage regardless) instead of resurrecting the deleted
      scaffolding.
- [ ] **tiletopia CloudFront default behavior caches authenticated responses ~1h**
      (post-MVP decision): Authorization is in the cache key so no cross-user leak,
      but a revoked token's responses keep serving until TTL. Clean fix: split the
      two public tile patterns into an aggressive-TTL behavior, default to TTL 0.
- [ ] **CloudFront realtime WS untested**: auth rides Sec-WebSocket-Protocol, which
      the distribution never forwards explicitly; collab may fail closed through the
      CDN. Test on a live distribution before relying on it.

## OPEN — post-MVP: tiletopia tile edge caching (decided 2026-07-28)

- [ ] The CloudFront `/tiles/v1/*` cache behaviors have never matched a real
      tiletopia route, so tiles are not edge-cached on AWS (they ride the safe
      TTL-0 default). Aliasing the API under `/tiles/v1/` is blocked three ways:
      tiletopia's `is_public_read` treats any path containing `/tiles/` as
      public (the alias would expose the whole authenticated GET surface),
      routes are registered with absolute paths, and four handlers emit
      absolute `/api/v1` URLs in responses. Viable designs, pick one post-MVP:
      host-based `tiles.<domain>` routing (native ALB support, but CORS and
      viewer URL changes), or first rewrite `is_public_read` to anchored
      prefix matches, then the route/URL refactor. A dead-behavior TODO sits
      in infrastructure/modules/cdn/main.tf until then.

## OPEN — deferred decision: private-asset tile gating

- [ ] tiletopia serves every asset's tiles publicly (`is_public_read`), even
      for private assets: anyone holding the asset id can read them. The
      aggressive CloudFront TTLs on tile paths depend on tiles staying
      public. If private assets ever need gated tiles, decide together:
      per-asset visibility check in the tile path AND a CDN redesign
      (authenticated tiles cannot keep the shared long-TTL cache).

## OPEN: NL agent as plan substrate (decided 2026-07-29)

Decision: the NL agent's differentiator is trust with local open models. Instead
of free-form sequential tool calls, the model emits a geodukt manifest as the
execution plan: visible before running, validated, lineage-tracked, rerunnable,
results downloadable via the new GeoPackage/Shapefile sinks. Three spec items
(typed tools, visible plans, provenance) collapse into this one substrate.
Order: substrate first, eval harness alongside, permission propagation before
anything multi-user ships, local packaging last.

- [~] **geodukt as plan substrate**: plan-then-approve flow shipped (see the
      history log). Still open: sql_query is only persona-discouraged, not
      labeled as a gated escape hatch in the rendered plan.
- [ ] **permission-aware enforcement (blocks multi-user)**: the caller's JWT now
      reaches ptolemy/tiletopia/geodukt (history log), so ptolemy's real RBAC
      applies. What is still missing is enforcement at the other end: tiletopia
      RBAC is type stubs, collecta checks nothing, and geolang's own `/tools`
      endpoint is unauthenticated, so anyone who can reach it runs tools as
      whatever token they present (no escalation, but no audit either).
      Security-sensitive work.
      Note: geodukt's `/run` gate is opt-in via `GEODUKT_JWT_SECRET`, unset in
      the local compose (owner decision 2026-07-29). Gating it by default meant
      an unauthenticated viewer session could not run a workflow at all, and the
      model answered the 401 by improvising with sql_query and the raw geopandas
      tools. Set it before this ships multi-user.
- [ ] **local deployment packaging (last)**: GPU detection, quantized model
      download, context config, inference-server setup. Wrap llama.cpp/ollama
      tooling rather than build. The differentiation lives in the eval harness
      proving which local model suffices, not in the installer.
- [ ] **agent-requested shading**: the user can shade a layer by a numeric field
      now, but must pick it by hand every time, even though the tool that wrote
      the layer knows which column matters (`gap_score`, `overall_risk`). Needs an
      optional classification field in the ui_spec layer format, geolang's
      emit_ui_spec schema and the persona. Do this before letting the tool prose
      mention shading again.
- [ ] **cross-session run history**: geodukt keeps every run with its manifest,
      steps and caller, at `GET /runs`, and nothing exposes it. The executed plan
      is visible only in the session that ran it. Needs a proxied route plus a
      list view, and an access decision first: records name users, and geodukt
      gates only `/run`, not `/runs`.

## OPEN — geodukt fixture drift (found 2026-07-29, harmless today)

- [ ] Two fixtures set parameters no transform reads, and sit in code paths that
      never validate or execute, so nothing caught them:
      `geodukt-core/src/visual.rs` sets `target_crs` on a reproject (the transform
      reads `to_crs`), and `geodukt-io/tests/docgen_tests.rs` nests parameters
      under `[transform.params]`, which the flattened manifest reads as a single
      parameter literally named `params`. Both would fail validation if those
      paths ever ran it.

## OPEN — verne: get your data out (named 2026-07-29, not started)

Rationale: lock-in, not features, is what stops an org moving off an incumbent
platform, and nothing in the tree reads a proprietary project or enterprise
database from one today. Vendor-neutral by design: a common core (connect,
inventory, report fidelity, extract) with a thin adapter per source, so no single
vendor shapes the architecture. Candidate adapters in rough order of demand: the
large enterprise GIS suites, the photogrammetry and reality-capture stacks, the
CAD-adjacent platforms, the earth-browser exports, and the legacy desktop
formats. Per-source feasibility must be checked against GDAL's driver list before
any adapter is committed to; do not assume a reader exists.

A new repo rather than geodukt, because the dependency surface (GDAL with
optional drivers, REST/token auth, possibly ODBC and vendor database clients) and
the risk profile (it holds customer credentials) should not land on every geodukt
user. It emits GeoPackage/Parquet plus a semantics sidecar; geodukt and ptolemy
consume that through the source interface they already have.

- [ ] **v0.1, read-only inventory.** Connect with operator-supplied credentials
      and report what is there, what GeoLang can represent faithfully, what it
      would approximate, and what has no home. Read-only first because a
      converter that silently drops the semantics is worse than no converter, and
      the report says which converters are worth building from real customer data
      instead of guesses. The report is also the sales artifact.
- [ ] **the semantics with no target** (the actual work; geometry and attributes
      are the easy fifth and GDAL does most of that). The specifics differ per
      vendor but the categories repeat: attribute domains and subtypes, typed
      relationships with cardinality, validation and topology rules, cartographic
      text as features, network and utility models, styling and print layouts,
      attachments, metadata, and edit history. Schema concerns like domains and
      subtypes belong in ptolemy, not in a store verne invents. Versioned edit
      history maps onto ptolemy's branching better than onto anything else this
      platform could migrate to, which is where the real fidelity advantage is.
- [ ] **licence boundaries, needs a human to read each vendor's current terms.**
      The line is the same everywhere: the customer's own data in formats they
      hold, and their own hosted content through documented APIs with their own
      credentials, is clean. Vendor-supplied licensed content (basemaps,
      geocoders, demographic and imagery datasets) is not theirs to move, and
      neither is content they can merely see. Prefer open-source readers over
      vendor SDKs, several of which carry terms that do not sit with AGPL
      linking. "With permission" must be a mechanism, not a promise: explicit
      operator credentials and a log of what was extracted, nothing that sniffs
      or crawls.

## OPEN — sibyl cutover cleanup

- [ ] Session routing is still server-side-global (sibyl active flag mirrors the
      old behavior). Later cleanup: route runs by AG-UI `thread_id` so sessions
      are per-client and stateless; needs viewer session-switcher rework.

## OPEN — Phase 3 (mobile & ML breadth, after v1)

- [ ] **terravista v0.2** — HTTP tile fetch + MVT decode (the SDK can't fetch/draw tiles yet).
- [ ] **terravista v0.3** — Metal/Vulkan GPU rendering. Biggest advertised-vs-real gap; needs
      platform GPU toolchains.
- [ ] **panoptes model weights** — train or source one usable segmentation model and publish
      weights, or keep the repo clearly labeled experimental. Inference path itself is real.
- [ ] **collecta media attachments** — photo/document capture + sync (deferred from Phase 2).
- [ ] **viewtopia FleetPanel** — currently an honest "no live feed" state; nothing serves
      vehicle positions. Decide whether real-time fleet tracking is in scope before building
      a WS/ingest path for it.
- [ ] Preview-gated panels (18) — implement on demand, otherwise leave gated. Cheap wins if
      wanted: several reuse existing helpers.

## OPEN — deferred design decisions (not bugs)

- [ ] ptolemy merge is **feature-level** (edits to different attributes of one feature
      conflict). Attribute-level auto-merge would be a conflict-detection redesign; behavior
      is currently pinned by a test. Decide if it's worth it.
- [ ] ptolemy re-merge of an already-merged branch creates a redundant merge changeset each
      time (merge commits record only one parent, so the base never advances). "Already up to
      date" detection needs second-parent bookkeeping.
- [ ] ptolemy external-source pushdown non-goals (documented in README): near-global
      windows fall back to unfiltered scans; `or`/`not` CQL2 spatial ops are never pushed.
      Revisit only if a real workload hits them.
- [ ] **Split view: per-pane basemap picker, then tiled views** (owner, 2026-07-26,
      post-MVP). Panes currently share the basemap, so same-renderer split is a mirror.
      Step 1: each pane picks its own basemap, cameras stay locked (no focused-pane
      concept; viewer-scoped tools keep the left-pane convention). Build the pane state
      as a list of `{renderer, basemap}`, not a single right-pane entry, so step 2 —
      a 2x2 tiled compare view — is layout work, not a rewrite. Tiles are GL contexts:
      cap at 4, MapLibre by default, at most one Cesium instance.
- [ ] Raise jung from its rendering-only coverage into the v1 path *(only if it enters it)*.
