## OPEN — platform hygiene

- [ ] **tiletopia multi-node HA (raft)** — future reference, no open work. The
      openraft half of cluster.rs was deleted 2026-07-27: it was a never-compiled
      textbook key-value example wired to nothing (no transport, no discovery, no
      real server state through it). The single-process leader election that
      actually runs remains. If clustering ever becomes a requirement, design it
      around what needs replicating (catalog and auth state via Raft; tile data
      needs shared/object storage regardless) instead of resurrecting the deleted
      scaffolding.
- [ ] **tiletopia CloudFront default behavior caches authenticated responses ~1h**
      (post-MVP decision): Authorization is in the cache key so no cross-user leak,
      but a revoked token's responses keep serving until TTL. Clean fix: split the
      two public tile patterns into an aggressive-TTL behavior, default to TTL 0.
- [ ] **CloudFront realtime WS untested**: auth rides Sec-WebSocket-Protocol, which
      the distribution never forwards explicitly; collab may fail closed through the
      CDN. Test on a live distribution before relying on it.

## OPEN — post-MVP: tiletopia tile edge caching (decided 2026-07-28)

- [ ] The CloudFront `/tiles/v1/*` cache behaviors have never matched a real
      tiletopia route, so tiles are not edge-cached on AWS (they ride the safe
      TTL-0 default). Aliasing the API under `/tiles/v1/` is blocked three ways:
      tiletopia's `is_public_read` treats any path containing `/tiles/` as
      public (the alias would expose the whole authenticated GET surface),
      routes are registered with absolute paths, and four handlers emit
      absolute `/api/v1` URLs in responses. Viable designs, pick one post-MVP:
      host-based `tiles.<domain>` routing (native ALB support, but CORS and
      viewer URL changes), or first rewrite `is_public_read` to anchored
      prefix matches, then the route/URL refactor. A dead-behavior TODO sits
      in infrastructure/modules/cdn/main.tf until then.

## OPEN — deferred decision: private-asset tile gating

- [ ] tiletopia serves every asset's tiles publicly (`is_public_read`), even
      for private assets: anyone holding the asset id can read them. The
      aggressive CloudFront TTLs on tile paths depend on tiles staying
      public. If private assets ever need gated tiles, decide together:
      per-asset visibility check in the tile path AND a CDN redesign
      (authenticated tiles cannot keep the shared long-TTL cache).

## OPEN: NL agent as plan substrate (decided 2026-07-29)

Decision: the NL agent's differentiator is trust with local open models. Instead
of free-form sequential tool calls, the model emits a geodukt manifest as the
execution plan: visible before running, validated, lineage-tracked, rerunnable,
results downloadable via the new GeoPackage/Shapefile sinks. Three spec items
(typed tools, visible plans, provenance) collapse into this one substrate.
Order: substrate first, eval harness alongside, permission propagation before
anything multi-user ships, local packaging last.

- [~] **geodukt as plan substrate**: plan-then-approve flow shipped (see the
      history log). Still open: sql_query is only persona-discouraged, not
      labeled as a gated escape hatch in the rendered plan.
- [ ] **permission-aware enforcement (blocks multi-user)**: the caller's JWT now
      reaches ptolemy/tiletopia/geodukt (history log), so ptolemy's real RBAC
      applies. What is still missing is enforcement at the other end: tiletopia
      RBAC is type stubs, collecta checks nothing, and geolang's own `/tools`
      endpoint is unauthenticated, so anyone who can reach it runs tools as
      whatever token they present (no escalation, but no audit either).
      Security-sensitive work.
- [ ] **local deployment packaging (last)**: GPU detection, quantized model
      download, context config, inference-server setup. Wrap llama.cpp/ollama
      tooling rather than build. The differentiation lives in the eval harness
      proving which local model suffices, not in the installer.

## OPEN — sibyl cutover cleanup

- [ ] Session routing is still server-side-global (sibyl active flag mirrors the
      old behavior). Later cleanup: route runs by AG-UI `thread_id` so sessions
      are per-client and stateless; needs viewer session-switcher rework.

## OPEN — Phase 3 (mobile & ML breadth, after v1)

- [ ] **terravista v0.2** — HTTP tile fetch + MVT decode (the SDK can't fetch/draw tiles yet).
- [ ] **terravista v0.3** — Metal/Vulkan GPU rendering. Biggest advertised-vs-real gap; needs
      platform GPU toolchains.
- [ ] **panoptes model weights** — train or source one usable segmentation model and publish
      weights, or keep the repo clearly labeled experimental. Inference path itself is real.
- [ ] **collecta media attachments** — photo/document capture + sync (deferred from Phase 2).
- [ ] **viewtopia FleetPanel** — currently an honest "no live feed" state; nothing serves
      vehicle positions. Decide whether real-time fleet tracking is in scope before building
      a WS/ingest path for it.
- [ ] Preview-gated panels (18) — implement on demand, otherwise leave gated. Cheap wins if
      wanted: several reuse existing helpers.

## OPEN — deferred design decisions (not bugs)

- [ ] ptolemy merge is **feature-level** (edits to different attributes of one feature
      conflict). Attribute-level auto-merge would be a conflict-detection redesign; behavior
      is currently pinned by a test. Decide if it's worth it.
- [ ] ptolemy re-merge of an already-merged branch creates a redundant merge changeset each
      time (merge commits record only one parent, so the base never advances). "Already up to
      date" detection needs second-parent bookkeeping.
- [ ] ptolemy external-source pushdown non-goals (documented in README): near-global
      windows fall back to unfiltered scans; `or`/`not` CQL2 spatial ops are never pushed.
      Revisit only if a real workload hits them.
- [ ] **Split view: per-pane basemap picker, then tiled views** (owner, 2026-07-26,
      post-MVP). Panes currently share the basemap, so same-renderer split is a mirror.
      Step 1: each pane picks its own basemap, cameras stay locked (no focused-pane
      concept; viewer-scoped tools keep the left-pane convention). Build the pane state
      as a list of `{renderer, basemap}`, not a single right-pane entry, so step 2 —
      a 2x2 tiled compare view — is layout work, not a rewrite. Tiles are GL contexts:
      cap at 4, MapLibre by default, at most one Cesium instance.
- [ ] Raise jung from its rendering-only coverage into the v1 path *(only if it enters it)*.
